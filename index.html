          <h2 class="mini-headings">Brief Intro</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            I am a self-motivated, tenacious, and free-spirited 21 year old with
            a dedication towards managing and creating beautiful, interactive,
            and dynamic websites that engages user interaction. I am currently
            enrolled in the full-stack web development course in Umuzi, hoping
            to come out as a professional web developer by the end of my journey
            with them.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">My Journey</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            My journey to becoming a coder started back in February of 2021
            when, back when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, I
            came across an advertisement on the radio about an academy called
            WeThinkCode and how they were offering a course to students; for
            free and with no prerequisites! So me, not knowing what career field
            I wanted to go in, had every reason to go and try this course and
            see how it goes.<br />
            <br />
            While I didn't get into the academy, I did discover that this would
            be a career path that I would 100% be content with pursuing in the
            future, as it involved an aspect that I love to do, which is
            creating. Having something that I can call my own and can be proud
            of creating is what I strive for, as it serves as a kind of
            validation for yourself that you are the mastermind behind this
            thing.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">What Next?</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            So naturally, after this discovery, I enrolled for another coding
            career, and that's how I found myself in the position I'm in right
            now. Although I have a long journey ahead, I'm looking forward to
            seeing just where it will lead me in the future.

          <h2 class="mini-headings">What I Have learned</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            Visual Studio Code. It is the first editor that I learned and it is
            relatively beginner-friendly, so I have no reason to switch. With
            it, I have coded algorithms with javascript, as well as created this
            website with HTML and CSS. The Version Control System that I have
            learned is Git and Github so working and co-ordinating in teams is
            not a problem for me.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mini-headings">Still To Learn</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            I am looking to learn PostgreSQL, React JS, and Node.js in the
            future as required to become a web developer, but right now I am in
            the beginner stages of my journey and I know I have a lot to learn
            so I will update this in the future from "Still To Learn: X Y Z" to
            "Proficient In: X Y Z" :)

          <h2 class="mini-headings">Computer Stuff</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            Even before my journey started with coding, the way computers work
            in the background to give you the interface that you interact with
            has always fascinated me and I'm continuing to learn more about
            different systems and how they work. Along these comes my
            understanding of applications such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and
            others. Creating something I can call my own is the feeling I strive
            for, and that is why creating and perfecting code is my passion.
          </p>
          <h2 class="mini-headings">Music</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            One of the career fields that I was previously interested in was
            sound engineering, but mostly it was just me thinking that music was
            the whole of sound engineering, and later I realized that it was
            much more than that. So one thing I do is make a bunch of beats from
            the fresh ideas that come up in my head, although I realized that it
            is almost impossible to replicate what is in your head. The beats
            are very laid back and harmonic, just like the type of music I
            listen to. Even though these beats are objectively mediocre, I
            treasure them because to me they represent an idea I had that has
            not been mastered yet.
